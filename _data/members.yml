#   description: I see myself as having three main jobs, which (I hope) inform one 
#                another. I am a **behavioral neurologist**, and my clinical 
#                practice focuses on Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, 
#                and other cognitive disorders of aging. I am also a **cognitive 
#                neuroscientist**, applying observations from clinic to 
#                investigate why patients like mine are vulnerable to making bad 
#                decisions. Third, I am a **neuroethicist**, working alongside 
#                other clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to address the 
#                ethical and social implications of changes in decision-making due 
#                to altered brain function. 
               
               
#                I studied philosophy as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. During 
#                medical school here at UCSF, I took a leave to pursue a PhD in 
#                philosophy at NYU, where I studied with Thomas Nagel and Derek 
#                Parfit. After residency training in neurology back at UCSF, I did 
#                a combined fellowship in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging 
#                with [Mark D'Esposito](https://despolab.berkeley.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
#                at UC Berkeley and in behavioral neurology here at the 
#                [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](http://memory.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
              
              
#               Alongside my clinical and research work, I am the Director 
#               of [UCSF Bioethics](https://bioethics.ucsf.edu){:target="\_blank"} 
#               and a member of the the UCSF Medical Center Ethics Committee. 
#               Beyond UCSF, I serve on the 
#               [Neuroethics Working Group](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/about/neuroethics-working-group){:target="\_blank"} 
#               of the National Institutes of Health BRAIN (Brain Research through 
#               Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Multi-Council Working 
#               Group, the American Academy of Neurology's

#               of the International Neuroethics Society. I am also a research 
#               mentor in the Association of American Medical Colleges' Career 
#               Development Program for
