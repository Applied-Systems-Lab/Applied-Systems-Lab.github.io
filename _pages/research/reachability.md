<!-- ### Additional details/links: -->
Reachability is an important, broad, and wide-spread tool for the research group. Reachability is fundamentally the idea of exploring all possible states a dynamical system can visit ("reach") under its dynamics and various forms of uncertainty and input.  Our approach is largely set-based and specifically using the tools of zonotopes, constrained zonotopes, and hybrid zonotopes. Our approach to security and safety is tightly coupled with the reachability tools we develop. Below we describe a few of our reachability tools and insights and also our application of the tools to SLAM.
