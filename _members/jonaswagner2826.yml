description: "
Jonas Wagner is currently a Research Assistant and PhD student in the Applied Systems Lab withing the Mechanical Engineering department at The University of Texas at Dallas. 
Perviously, Jonas received their BS in both Engineering Physics and Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin - Platteville (along with a minor in Math).
\
Jonas enjoys teaching and is one of the Jonsson School's inaugural Dean's teaching fellows training to be an instructor of record.
Currently, they also serves as a mentor for UTD's EPICS (the undergraduate design program for local non-profit organizations); continuing the tradition of mentoring for the local FIRST robotics team while in undergrad.
\
Jonas's research has primarily focused on cyber-physical system security and the development of new set-based detection methods utilizing zonotope-based reachability analysis.
In addition, Jonas has continued the Applied Systems Lab's work with networks by expanding ICON to detect interconnections within systems with unmeasured states and non-linear dynamics.
