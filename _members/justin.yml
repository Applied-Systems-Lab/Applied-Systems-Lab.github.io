description: "

Justin Ruths is an associate professor in the departments of Mechanical Engineering and Systems Engineering at UT Dallas. 
Before that, Justin was an assistant professor and founding faculty member of Engineering Systems Design at the Singapore University of Technology and Design from 2011-2016.
He enjoys building things and understanding how things work. This has led him to the seemingly incongruous situation of building self-driving cars at work and maintaining a 1978 Chevy truck and 1962 Ford Bronco at home.
Recently he has been enchanted by the expressiveness of zonotope set-based methods and the beauty of their linear algebra interpretations. Topics of security, networks, system dynamics, and neuroscience continue to be areas of ongoing interest and work.
